### Bitcoin and Blockchain
Bitcoin: A digital currency using blockchain technology for peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.
Blockchain: A decentralized digital ledger storing transaction data across many computers.
### Ethereum and Smart Contracts
Ethereum: A blockchain that supports decentralized transactions, organizations, and agreements through smart contracts.
Smart Contracts: Self-executing contracts with terms written in code, enabling decentralized execution without intermediaries.

## Features of Smart Contracts
### Decentralization
No centralized intermediary; runs on a blockchain maintained by many node operators.
### Transparency and Flexibility
Transparent ensuring fairness without compromising privacy.
### Speed and Efficiency
Faster than traditional banking systems blockchain transactions are nearly instant.
### Security and Immutability
Once deployed, smart contracts can't be altered. Blockchain's decentralized nature makes hacking difficult.
### Elimination of Counterparty Risk
No trust required; terms can't be changed once the contract is deployed.

## Applications of Smart Contracts
### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Enables financial transactions without intermediaries offering transparent access to markets.
## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
Governed by smart contracts, providing transparent and decentralized governance.
## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
Digital unique assets or art, enabling creators to monetize their work.
## Other Applications
Potential for new innovations in smart contract uses.
